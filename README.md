# Google Maps Lite

Project in Python focused on Data Structures and Algorithms. 

The project involved developing a smaller version of Google Maps, specifically tailored to the city of Mumbai. Leveraging various data structures and algorithms to optimize the mapping process, including DFS, BFS, GBFS, A_star algorithms for finding the shortest path between two locations.  

Overall, the project aimed to demonstrate the practical application of data structures and algorithms in a real-world setting.
